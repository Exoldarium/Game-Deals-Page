## General info

I made this website as a way to practice JavaScript. On it's surface it's a simple CRUD application but it was made 100% without any
frameworks, compilers or libraries. Everything was built from scratch.
	
## Technologies

I'm using pure JavaScript ES6, HTML and CSS.
I'm getting the data from [CheapsharkAPI](https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/)
