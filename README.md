## General info
Decide to build this app as my first project. I've decided to build this app without using any framworks,  compilers and libraries as a way to learn more about 
JavaScript, CSS and HTML and as a way to challenge myself.

One of the challenges was being able to correctly show and persist the filtered data that the user searches. I've learned a lot about promises, asynchronous side
of JavaScript and how to work with an API and display the data i need. I will probaly update and improve the code as i learn more.

The images were designed by my lovely wife.

## To-do
Add pagination

Add some sort of log-in function
